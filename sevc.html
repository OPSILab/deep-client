These output files provide site outlines. The DLR_PlanningAppsNull.* lists applications which have no spatial component. NB: Shp files have a limit on their field sizes which will result in loss of some attribute data.\r\n- Output files are also provided in csv, json and kml formats. These files (DLR_PlanningApps_csv.csv, DLR_PlanApps.kml and DLR_PlanApps.json) provide Lat\/Long and ITM co-ordinates.

This may account for some discrepancies which may occur when overlain with other data. This data is optimally viewed at a scale of 1:1000. Where point data is provided in csv, kml and json formats, these points broadly represent the site but do not represent it\r\ns exact outline, extent or central location.
